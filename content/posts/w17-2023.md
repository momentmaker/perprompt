I also solved several challenges without its help--partially because it's not always easy to give it all the context it needs to answer a question. You can't, for example, send it a 30MB APK file and then ask for help reverse engineering it, or copy all of the source code for a web app into GPT-4 and ask it to find the vulnerabilities. You can get help with smaller chunks of these problems, but I could see this technology getting way more powerful in the future. { {{< tag ctf >}} }

I sat on it because I wasn’t sure of the optics of posting such an essay while employed by Google Brain. But then Google made my decision easier by laying me off in January. My severance check cleared, and last week, Brain and DeepMind merged into one new unit, killing the Brain brand in favor of “Google DeepMind”.
