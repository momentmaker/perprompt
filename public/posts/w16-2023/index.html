 - The company behind the popular iPhone customization app Brass, sticker maker StickerHub and others is out today with a new AI chat app called Superchat, which allows iOS users to chat with virtual characters powered by OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT. However, what makes the app different from the default ChatGPT experience or the dozens of generic AI chat apps now available are the characters offered, which you can use to engage with Superchat‚Äôs AI features.</p>

 | [<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35614332">üí¨ discussion</a>] - Deep generative models are becoming increasingly powerful, now generating diverse high fidelity photo-realistic samples given text prompts. Have they reached the point where models of natural images can be used for generative data augmentation, helping to improve challenging discriminative tasks? We show that large-scale text-to image diffusion models can be fine-tuned to produce class conditional models with SOTA FID (1.76 at 256x256 resolution) and Inception Score (239 at 256x256). The model also yields a new SOTA in Classification Accuracy Scores (64.96 for 256x256 generative samples, improving to 69.24 for 1024x1024 samples). Augmenting the ImageNet training set with samples from the resulting models yields significant improvements in ImageNet classification accuracy over strong ResNet and Vision Transformer baselines.</p>

Specifically, projects like AutoGPT, BabyAGI, CAMEL, and Generative Agents have popped up. The LangChain community has now implemented some parts of all of those projects in the LangChain framework. While researching and implementing these projects, we‚Äôve tried to best understand what the differences between them are and what the novel features of each are.
